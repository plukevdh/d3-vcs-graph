# D3 VCS Graphs

Use D3 to visualize simple vcs branching operations.

This simple project is designed to help people understand some basic vcs concepts visually.

I stole most of this code without license from: https://github.com/onlywei/explain-git-with-d3. Apologies, but the original author didn't provide a license and I really liked what he was doing. @onlywei: Add a license man!!

## Compile

To have coffee watch your file dir for changes:

`coffee -wcmo js coffee`

or leave off the `w` to compile once.
